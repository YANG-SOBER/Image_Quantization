### What is image quantization?

Use Point Operator (pixel-by-pixel) to quantize the image.

Quantization means rounding the gray values to a set of discrete values.

Actually, binary image with two values is a special case of quantization.

For a optimal image encoding: use the quantization that minimize the rounding error given the image.
